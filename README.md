# ACME App Basket System

## Overview

This application implements a basket system for **Acme Widget Co.**, allowing customers to:
- Add products to a basket.
- Calculate the total cost of the basket, including:
  - Special offers (e.g., "Buy one red widget, get the second at half price").
  - Delivery costs based on the basket's subtotal.

The project is built using **PHP** and adheres to clean coding practices, including:
- **Dependency Injection**
- **Strategy Pattern**
- **PSR-4 Autoloading**

### Assumptions
- We are having product catalogue of unique product code identifier (R01+B01+G01).
- If basket have two or more products of (R01) code, then we are considering every second red-widget product on half price. E.g (R01 + R01 One will be on full price and other will be half price) 
- And then there is a functionality calculating the total of basket by considering the (Buy one red widget , get the second on half price + Delivery charges applicable on base of total of basket).

## Features

1. **Product Management**  
   Products are represented with:
   - `code` (e.g., `R01`, `G01`)
   - `name` (e.g., "Red Widget")
   - `price` (e.g., `32.95`)

2. **Basket System**  
   - Add products by their `code`.
   - Calculate the total cost, including:
     - Discounts from special offers.
     - Delivery costs based on subtotal rules.

3. **Special Offers**  
   This implementation supports the following offer:
   - "Buy one red widget, get the second at half price."

4. **Delivery Costs**  
   Delivery charges are based on the subtotal:
   - Subtotal < $50: $4.95
   - Subtotal < $90: $2.95
   - Subtotal â‰¥ $90: Free delivery
